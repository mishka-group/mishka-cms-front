This is a React/Next JS frontend version that uses [MishkaCms API](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka-cms), which is Powered by TypeScript.

**NOTICE**: Do not use the master branch; this library is under heavy development. Please wait until a new release is out.

Mishka project is a real-time and also API-based CMS which is developed using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming language; powered by [Phoenix framework](https://phoenixframework.org/). In this project it is tried to place all the dependencies in the Elixir language and avoid using external systems, and it has been this way so far except for the database section which we used [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
